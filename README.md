# Nine Man's Morris Game

Made using c++ with SFML framework

RULES:

The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces, or "men", coloured GREEN and RED. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.

The game proceeds in three phases:

1. -> Placing men on vacant points
2. -> Moving men to adjacent points
3. -> (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men

HAVE FUN!!!
